## Short description

### What's the problem?
* False alarms can be a major hazard to any fire alarm system since they lead to a loss of confidence in the system. It is important that any alarm from the system be treated as an alarm of fire until it can be proved to be false, rather than being treated as false until proven to be a fire. 

* Wastage of resources due to unwarranted allocation to the non-existent threats, curtailing SCDF’s ability to target real threats. 

### How can technology help?
* Internet-of-Things (IoT) technology can be installed into existing fire alarm systems for smarter detection of threats. These detection systems would be able to gather important data from the threat, allowing SCDF personnel to make informed decisions based on the ground situation and formulate strategic plans to fight the threat.  

* Using state-of-the-art artificial intelligence technology, like Computer Vision, we can better analyse datasets provided from the smart systems aforementioned, providing real-time support for SCDF personnel to swiftly act upon the danger with appropriate amount of resources while evacuating civilians safely from the threat in a timely and fashioned manner. 

* By using the limited resources in a targeted and efficient way, SCDF will be able to handle more situations in a given period of time. 



### The idea
Deploying deep learning techniques to analyse data from past fire alarms, we can more accurately judge the severity of fires given factors such as (…). This will allow SCDF to make more informed decisions when allocating resources.  

## The architecture

![architecture.png](https://github.com/jasperosy/Coffeebreak-Placeholder_SCDFXIBM/blob/master/architecture.png)

1. When the fire alarm rings, the sensors in the fire alarm will record environmental data, storing it in a backend database. 
2. Severity rating is determined by performing classification on environmental data. 
3. If the alarm is determined to be a false alarm, an announcement will be made. 
4. If a real fire has broken out, SCDF will be notified. Severity rating will be used to recommend an appropriate amount of resources that should be deployed to combat the emergency.
